I have developed an Instagram Clone using Flutter and Firebase, with guidance from a comprehensive YouTube tutorial. This project significantly enhanced my understanding of Firebase, providing a more precise insight into its functionalities.

**Framework:** Flutter  
**Database and Backend:** Firebase  
**State Management:** Provider  

This hands-on experience not only allowed me to explore the capabilities of Flutter but also deepened my knowledge of Firebase. The utilization of the Provider package for state management added an extra layer of efficiency to the application. Overall, this project served as a valuable learning opportunity and a practical application of the skills acquired through the tutorial.
