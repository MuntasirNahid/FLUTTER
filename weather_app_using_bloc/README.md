## About The Project
**We are building an **AI-Powered Expense Tracker** Mobile Application.**

**The Problem:** Every one of us faces the problem of spending too much money. Let's say we go out with a 1000tk note, but when we come back home, we find that there is only 100tk left in our pocket. We don't know **how the money went**. We become astonished every time. We need to rein in our overspending habits.

To spend wisely, there is an old method used by Japanese housewives. They used to write with a **pen and paper** every time they spent money. After a certain time, when they saw their spending list, it reminded them that they were spending more money on unnecessary things, and they could then rein in their spending in those areas.

Nowadays, for us, it becomes a **tiresome** and **boring** process to write with a pen and paper every time we spend money. Maintaining an Excel or Google sheet is also a tiresome and boring process. People start using them with **high motivation**, but after some time, they **stop** using them because of the **lengthy** and **boring** process of **inputting** their daily expenditures. Here comes our solution to this problem.

**Solution:** In our AI-powered Personal Finance Tracker Mobile Application, we can easily create new **spending categories** like "Grocery Shopping, Tour Cost, Bills, Business," etc. Then, we can provide the user with the most user-friendly experience using our AI-powered **Chat Bot**.

We **don't need to input in an ancient way** like **clicking** and selecting buttons forever. As we are very **familiar with chatting**, we can easily chat with our chatbot, and our chatbot will **create/update** a table for that corresponding expenditure category. For example, when we write "Today I spent 300tk to buy fish" or "Ajke 300 takar mach kinsi" (in our **Banglish** style), our AI-powered system will update the table accordingly and respond like "Alright! 300Tk spent on buying fish is updated in the table, and your total spending today is 300Tk" (it will sum if we give more prompts).

Our app offers **speech-to-text** recognition and responds accordingly. So if any of our users find chatting with the chatbot difficult, then they can easily insert their expenditure into our app with a voice command.

As our app will give him **reminders in every response about his expenditure**, he can easily make his mind spend less.

Another feature our app will provide is **query facility**. Sometimes when we go to our nearest shop, we often see that the price of our daily goods products just increases, or sometimes we need to see how much we spent on a specific thing last time. We can easily query our chatbot, like "What was the fish price last time?" Our chatbot will reply, "Last time you bought fish for 300tk." **This will help the user to be aware of his spending increase or decrease, and he can easily plan to tackle it.**

**Scalability**:

1. We can easily implement the concept of **machine learning** here. As our chatbot will be trained more and more with the use of the user, this will help our chatbot respond in a very efficient and quick way.
2. We can attach a **budget planner** concept with our app. As our chatbot will know about our spending habits, it can easily help us create a budget planner.
3. A **push notification** feature will be very effective for our mobile app. Our user will be real-time aware of his budget planning and spending habits. He can easily compare his spending categories.

As we have implemented a **layer-based clean code architecture in Flutter**, we hope that scaling our project will not be that hard a task.
